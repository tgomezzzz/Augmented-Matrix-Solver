# Gauss-Jordan Elimination Calculator

This program solves systems of equations, represented by an augmented matrix, using Gauss-Jordan Elimination.

How to use:

Upon executing the program, enter each value of the matrix's first row separated by a space.
To move onto the next row, press [enter]. If any of the following rows' lengths are not the same as the first, or if any of their values are non-numerical, the program will prompt you to re-enter the row.
Once all values have been entered, press [d], and then [enter].
The program will print the matrix. Press [y] and then [enter] to solve, or anything else to re-enter the matrix.
